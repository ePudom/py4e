# Write a program that reads a file and prints the letters
# in decreasing order of frequency. Your program should convert all the
# input to lower case and only count the letters a-z. Your program should
# not count spaces, digits, punctuation, or anything other than the letters
# a-z. Find text samples from several different languages and see how
# letter frequency varies between languages. Compare your results with
# the tables at https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies.
